Simulated Card Game of War. Human vs. Computer.

A simulated game of the card game war that allows a human to play against the computer. You can choose to view each round one at a time or you can choose to allow the game to run through every move quickly without stopping. The game has a dealer that shuffles the cards, splits the deck in half, and gives the cards to each player to start the game. The program then runs through the game of war, keeping the human player updated on their card total as well as letting them know the cards that were flipped by both players.
